# Risk-prevention-app
Risk prevention app. It enables workers and supervisors at a construction to report, share, respond and resolve risk situations at work.
## General info
This project makes it possible for workers or supervisors at a construction to upload a construction risk report, filling out a dynamic form defined with a web service, adding pictures, videos or audios and sending it to a particular supervisor working on this construction.On login, the app determines if the user is a construction worker or a supervisor. There is a basic mode for construction workers, and an advanced mode for supervisors. The basic mode lets workers report incidents to a specific supervisor and receive an answer, navigate through a risk prevention library (which is a web viewer) and look at the history of reports. The advanced mode has the same functions, with some extra ones: the advanced mode lets supervisors share reports with other supervisors on the same construction, answer reports and add more information and/or media.When doing a report the app uses the phone's location to recognize quickly at which construction the user is currently standing, and with this information the formulary is loaded and the list of available supervisors to report to, etc.
